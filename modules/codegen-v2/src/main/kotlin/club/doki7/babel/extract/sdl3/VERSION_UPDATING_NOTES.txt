When updating SDL3 version, please follow these steps:

- Make a diff between the current SDL3 headers and the new ones;
- Figure out newly-added bitmask and enum types;
- Add them to `knownEnumAndBitmask.kt`;
- Figure out newly-added non-trivial macros;
- Add them and proper expansion to `knownMacros.kt`;
- Figure out newly-added troublesome structures (nested structs with anonymous structure names, etc);
- Add them to `knownTroublesomeStructures.kt` and provide a proper workaround;

See the comment in `knownEnumAndBitmask.kt` for more details.
