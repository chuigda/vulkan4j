/// OpenGL ES2 Java bindings implemented with Java22 FFM (Project Panama) APIs.
///
/// OpenGL ES is royalty-free, cross-platform API for full-function 2D and 3D graphics on embedded
/// systems - including consoles, phones, appliances and vehicles. It consists of well-defined
/// subsets of desktop OpenGL, creating a flexible and powerful low-level interface between software
/// and graphics acceleration.
///
/// <b>Note</b> that this module only contains core APIs of OpenGL ES 2.0. Our team is still working
/// to figure out an ideal way of binding and delivering all OpenGL versions and extensions.
///
/// For OpenGL ES2 reference, see <a href="https://docs.gl/es2/glActiveTexture">docs.gl</a>.
