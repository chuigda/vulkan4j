## UNRELEASED v0.3.2

### Breaking changes

- Made all the `Iter` types private to reduce disruptions in JavaDoc pages. Most code should not be affected. Existing code that really uses `T.Iter` type can migrate to `Iterator<T>` interface.

### Functionality updates

- Added `allocateV` and `writeV` series functions for `Ptr` types (both `ffm-plus` and other generated code), utilizing Java varargs to simplify specific write operations.
- Supported chaining `set` methods for structure types.
- Supported LWJGL-alike `set` style methods for structure member of structure types. For example:
    ```c
    struct { struct { int a; int b; } inner; } outer;
    outer.inner.a = 1;
    outer.inner.b = 2;
    ```
    can now be written as:
    ```java
    outer.inner(it -> it.a(1).b(2));
    ```

### Bugfixes

- Fixed issue (#12), where some instance level commands are wrongly categorized as device commands.

## v0.3.1

- Fixed a issue (#63) causing incorrect generation of `StructureType.Ptr.reinterpret` series methods.
- Fixed a documentation issue in `vma` module.

## v0.3.0

A fresh start

- Migrating all extraction and code generation to Kotlin `codegen-v2` module.
- Entities are renamed properly to reduce boilerplates.
