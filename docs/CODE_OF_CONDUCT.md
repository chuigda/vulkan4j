## **Code of Conduct**

### **Our Pledge**

To foster an open, friendly, and productive environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, are dedicated to providing a safe and harassment-free experience for everyone.

### **Our Standards**

All community members are expected to adhere to the following core principles:

* **Communicate with Civility and Respect**
    Discussions should focus on the topic at hand. Be friendly, be open to constructive criticism, and avoid personal attacks, sarcasm, or any form of offensive remarks.

* **Stay on Topic, No "Keyboard Politics"**
    To maintain a focused and harmonious atmosphere, please do not post or discuss topics unrelated to the community's purpose, especially controversial or inflammatory political subjects.

* **No Discrimination, Act with Sincerity**
    We stand firmly against any form of discrimination based on race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, origin, or other personal attributes. We strive for an environment of genuine, action-based respect, not one of performative slogans. Please engage in good faith and avoid using anti-discrimination principles as a weapon to attack others or engaging in pointless semantic debates.

### **Our Responsibilities**

Project maintainers/community administrators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct and will take fair and appropriate corrective action in response to any behavior they deem to be in violation of these standards. This may include, but is not limited to, issuing a warning, a temporary ban, or a permanent ban from the community.

### **Reporting**

If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please contact the project team via Discord message. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, and the confidentiality of the reporter will be respected.
