## Introduction

So far our program manages memory for buffers and images manually. This is not a good idea in a real application. It is better to use a memory allocator library that will do this for us. There are several libraries available that can do this, but in this chapter we will use the Vulkan Memory Allocator library. This library is easy to use and has good performance.
